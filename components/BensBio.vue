      In his free time, Ben enjoys spending time with his 3-year-old border
      collie, taking him on long walks in the field or going on several-hour
      hikes. He also has a passion for gardening and tends to his beloved
      collection of houseplants, which he talks to and sings to in order to help
      them grow.

    <div>
      When he's not busy with his plants or his dog, you can find him conjuring
      up new spells and incantations to use in his software engineering work.
